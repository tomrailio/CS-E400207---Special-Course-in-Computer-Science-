This text appears to be describing someone who regularly washes their "dark suit" (presumably clothing) using something called "greasy wash water." While the exact meaning of "greasy wash water" is unclear, it implies that there may be some kind of oily substance mixed into the water used for cleaning. However, without further context it is difficult to provide more specific interpretations or meanings. Is there something else I can assist you with?
